		<h2>Sports 🏋️‍♀️</h2>
		<p>I love to go running or to the gym, it allows me to let off steam and think about other things. When I was younger, I also did badminton, ballet and swimming. I really like sports but I have to find the time to do more each week because I don't have much time.</p>

		<h2>Profesional experience 📝</h2>
		<p>I had some professional experiences that allowed me to discover new domains: human resources, publishing, sales in stores, sales on markets... I also do voluntary work: in a rescue center for animals in Ecuador and at the restos du coeur in Paris. </p>
